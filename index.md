## About myself

Driven DevOps engineer specialised in developing and maintaining Kubernetes clusters. Always interested in the newest developments in multiple technical areas, such as: new programming languages (i.e. Rust, Go), running Kubernetes on baremetal (RPI Turing 2), Webdevelopment (Svelte, WASM). 2 years of working experience, 5+ years of experience in Linux environments.
